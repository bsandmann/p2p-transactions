## 2022-07-27 The three stages of trust
While the last time (interrupted by the summer vacations) the work was very much about the wallet, the SDK and Catalyst, I continued with the already overdue white paper. The central question is how to enable trust between two parties without a central platform. A goal that I realize increasingly is actually a step too far. It tries to realize something for which some foundations are missing. Not that it can't be done, but without those foundations it can only be a PoC and nothing more—and that would be a waste. 

In my opinion, there are three stages of creating trust on the web: The first, and the easiest stage, is to make a statement and make it verifiable by others. I have already explained this topic in detail in the proposal "PRISM credentials for the web" and on the website (https://blocktrust.dev/WebCredentials). With this first level, positive statements can be presented in a trustworthy (and verifiable) way on the web. The second level of the trust hierarchy is to be able to present both positive and negative statements on the web in a trustworthy manner. While at the first level there are ways to suppress negative statements, at the second level it must be technically ensured that this is not possible. The manifestation of this idea is a review system for PRISM. This always involves one party making a statement to another party. In the third stage, the review system gets extended so that two parties can make statements about each other. It is easy to see how this third problem is the most complicated to solve.

My original proposal (naively) set out to solve the third problem, while the first two before that have not been solved by anybody yet either. Thus, working on the third issue is always working on the underlying two problems as well. Correspondingly, it takes a little longer than originally anticipated—but I would consider this to be positive, since along the way the other issues are also addressed and shaped into tangible implementation concepts, PoCs and new proposals. The solutions are not just questions of what my code looks like, but also questions of how to standardize schemas in general and what changes would have to be made to the PRISM SDK and the Node itself to be able to solve all of these three stages in a technically clean way.
So, work continues on the white paper (currently primarily concepts for extending the PRISM node and implementation ideas for the review system) and some concrete implementations along the way.


## 2022-06-18 An alternative way of looking at things
The focus of the work has shifted a bit in the last weeks: instead of continuing to work on the concrete implementation of the proposal, I first focused on the technical foundation. As noted before, the situation around the SDK is still very unclear. Although the announcement to make the SDK public is still floating in the air as ever, there is still nothing definite. The hope that something will happen in the near future is rather low. And the situation is understandable: with the publication of the SDK, IOG also opens its business model to third parties: a strategic decision with consequences that cannot be reversed. Securing the business model instead by locking the SDK (and thus access to the Node) behind a paywall is thus understandable - although I believe that such a decision, should it be made, will not have a positive impact on the ecosystem.

And how is this relevant to my proposal? In the technical implementation I have always assumed that for each transaction usually 4 credentials are written to the blockchain: 2 for the start of the transaction and 2 for the completion of the transaction. Due to the architecture of PRISM, this is inevitable as there are no multi-signature credentials. A (possible) business strategy that attempts to generate revenue from issuing credentials is difficult to be compatible with this type of proposal: the cost would theoretically have to be in the low cents for all four transactions combined for the concept to work in the real world. A scenario that seems unrealistic in the current setup of Cardano and Atala PRISM. So instead of trusting that the proposal can be built on a business model of PRISM, I looked at alternatives: What would it mean to write an SDK and a Node myself? Similar to PRISM, but not identical. What could multi-sig credentials look like and how could the cost to write to the blockchain be reduced? These questions have not all been answered, but the first step has resulted in an SDK that is compatible with the PRISM SDK, but architecturally different and based on .net. Not because the Kotlin SDK is bad, but because it gives me the freedom to continue working on the PoC for the proposal. The SDK is explicitly not part of the proposal, but a way to implement the proposal. 

Where do we go from here? First, a light wallet (a browser extension) has been created in the last few weeks based on the SDK, which will be the starting point for the wallet to be used in the proposal. This light wallet can be further developed relatively quickly (thanks to .net MAUI) into an Android wallet. Furthermore, a website is currently being created under the label "blocktrust" with a summary of the technologies and proposals that have all grown out of the original proposal. So things are moving forward - perhaps not always focused on the envisioned goal of the proposal - but still in a big way: all for a better world with SSI.


## 2022-04-23 Continued POC and questions regarding the SDK
In addition to the continued immersion in SSI specific topics, the POC was the central topic of the last weeks. The white paper was postponed somewhat in favor of practical experience with the SDK. In the course of this, various problems in the architecture of the SDK were revealed: For example, the SDK always assumes that the private keys are known within the SDK. Signing credentials via a browser wallet is not natively supported. To implement such capabilities, new functions had to be written, which required some code duplication. In other places, too, one gets the impression that the SDK was written only for an Atala-specific application purpose and not from a perspective that is open to alternative application use cases.

As far as the release of the SDK is concerned, there is still some uncertainty: It has not yet been communicated to what extent the node will be released, who will be allowed to run the node, how the accounting-model on the node will work, if there will be node-as-service operators, etc. The questions primarily concern the business model of Atala PRISM and less the implementation of the proposal. Nevertheless, they are critical to the way forward and the underlying structure of the implementation of the proposal. At the heart of this is the question: who will pay for the costs of issuing credentials and how can they be paid? Regardless of the costs themselves (and their amount), this has architectural implications and questions the philosophy behind P2P transactions: In addition to the transactions for issuing a transaction token, does there need to be a transaction for payment? One is a transaction against the PRISM node, the other is a transaction against the Cardano blockchain. How would an integrated wallet look like to consolidate this whole process into one user action in a user-friendly way? Or does one use a centralized service where there is a settlement account? The most convenient solution from the user's point of view, but not necessarily in the spirit of the very idea of creating a decentralized solution. Unfortunately, all these questions cannot be answered yet, because IOG does not release any information about this at the moment.

In a conversation with Tony Rose (product manager for PRSIM) I was able to raise these points personally. The result was also only that the business model on the part of IOG is not yet definitely determined. Regardless of the unclear strategy regarding the SDK, the support on the part of PRISM is very good.
Besides these developments, there were two weeks of Easter vacation for me, so that work will resume regularly at the end of April. 


## 2022-03-30 Research and POC Planing
After a few days of CA-work, the research continued: step by step, it goes deeper into the SSI material and new ideas are emerging. Primary focus is to dig into DID specifications and to think through possible workflows for different trust models.

Along the way, the technical design for a POC is starting. The approach is currently to provide several generic modules as a microservice: For DID-based authentication, for creating, tracing and verifying them. Above all, there is always the question of complexity in the architecture conception. How does one want to build such a system? How small-scale do you want to be with the microservices, or is a system that consists of perhaps only two or three components and is tightly coupled sufficient for a POC?


## 2022-03-17 Research & notes on the whitepaper
After the completion of the PRISM Pioneers program a few months have gone by, so I started working through some of the already visited material to get a better understanding of a few technical details. The new version (1.3.1-SP1) was integrated and some experiments completed. There are still a lot of open questions regarding the release version of the SDK and the node itself. Especially around the business model of IOG.

In addition to the technical experiments the research around trust-models, SSI and possible cryptographic solutions to the trust problem is ongoing. This will likely continue for the next weeks: mainly studying the *W3C* specifications in detail and reading *Self-Sovereign Identity* by *Alex Preukschat* and *Drummond Reed*. Meanwhile I’m taking a lot of notes which I’ll compile to a draft of the whitepaper.

A first result of the research phase is a new proposal for *Fund 8: Self-Souvereign identity* which can be found [here]( https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404879). The proposal has an overlapping with the ongoing proposal, but only regarding theoretical aspects – not technical ones. It is about the trust-building phase before a transaction even happens. In the proposal we try to find a better way to do endorsement on the web. Have a look at the proposal or visit [blocktrust.dev](http://blocktrust.dev). 

The project is schedueld to be finished until 2022-09-30 (End of September 2022)
